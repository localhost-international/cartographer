## tl;dr

Development of a decentralised web browser rather than an Etheruem wallet will create the groundowork and mindshare for eventual decentralised applications and services that will be the catalyst for a decentalised operating system viable for the next 10 years.


Countries like India and entire continents such as Africa are becoming more readiily online and  would benefit from technolgies that aren't purely dependant the whims and servicing of tecnoligically and financially powerful countries, economies and companies that usually cater to users living in Western markets.

## Wireless + P2P + Decentralized

In the short to longterm, peer to peer and wireless technolgies will play big part of the browsers featureset. 
5G wireless technolies have yet to specify if phones and computers with adequate wireless chipsets can or could become a part of the _{insert clear and concise definations of what limitations 5G wireless has in it's design which encourages higher densities of "cell sites" that mobile devices could bridge these devides, including how said devices could have light clients PoWing blockchains}_




## UX + Design 


The little things. Like colour coding unfamiliar pro







## Phases


### Chapter One. Native Mobile Web Browser

* Build some



### Chapter - Two - Browser with Content Creation

* Think MySpace and GeoCities of yore
* Make the web what it hoped to be with the unidirection consumption and creativity, all living on IPFS and DAT for data sroage and the Ethereum blockchain, as Tim wouldv'e wanted
* BeakerBrowser
