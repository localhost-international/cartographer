# Cartographer
_An experimental mobile web browser_

> Note: Cartographer is a very early work in progress, so approach with caution.



Cartographer is an experimental web browser, technology demo and user interface/experience playground.  
It's focus will be on supporting decentralised and peer to peer technologies (such as DAT/Hypercore and web3), but is mainly being built because: it's fun!

If you're looking for mature, feature rich browsers that support such technologies, please consider:

**DAT/Hypercore**

* [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) - A peer-to-peer browser for Web hackers (desktop)
* [Gateway Browser](https://twitter.com/GatewayBrowser) - An experimental mobile browser that aims to help build a sustainable community-owned P2P web (mobile)
* [Agregore](https://github.com/RangerMauve/agregore-browser) - A minimal web browser for the distributed web

**Ethereum**

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps
- [Status](https://status.im/) - Status is a secure messaging app, crypto wallet, and Web3 browser built with state of the art technology


## Download

Interested in testing Cartographer on iOS but not comfortable with compiling from source and/or don't have the tools?  

Then [leave a comment on this issue](https://github.com/localhost-international/cartographer/issues/2) and we'll get you added to TestFlight.  

Interested in running on Android? [See this issue](https://github.com/localhost-international/cartographer/issues/1).  

## Development

### Building

If you haven't already, [install React Native and it's dependancies](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).  

### iOS and iPadOS

Building Cartographer requires Xcode 11+, cocoapds and Node 14+.

1. `yarn install`
2. `npx pod-install ios` or `cd ios/ && pod install && cd ..`
3. `open ios/Cartographer.xcworkspace/`
4. Then a select a simulator or device and "Run"

If you encounter any trouble with the above, replace step 2. with:

* `cd ios/ && pod deintegrate && pod install && cd ..`


### Android 

Cartographer is currently in development and is being optimised for iOS/iPadOS.  

[Leave a comment on the Android Support issue](https://github.com/localhost-international/cartographer/issues/1) so I know you're interested in an Android compatibility/release.

Building Cartographer for Android requires Android Studio 4.0+ and OpenJDK 8.

1. `yarn install`
2. `npx react-native run-android`


### Tests 

TODO - Not exactly TDD, but it'll soon come.
