# Cartographer
_An experimental mobile web browser_

> Note: Cartographer is a very early work in progress, so approach with caution.



Cartographer is an experimental web browser, technology demo and user interface/experience playground.  
It's focus will be on supporting distributed, decentralised and peer to peer technologies such as Ethereum, IPFS and Hypercore.  

It's mostly being built because: building things is fun.

If you're looking for more mature, feature rich web browsers that support distributed and decentralised web technologies, please see our [P2P Web Browsers](./docs/p2p-web-browsers.md) document.
