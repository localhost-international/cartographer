# Cartographer
_An experimental mobile web browser_

> Note: Cartographer is a very early work in progress, so approach with caution.



Cartographer is an experimental web browser, technology demo and user interface/experience playground.  
It's focus will be on supporting decentralised and peer to peer technologies (such as DAT/Hypercore and web3), but is mainly being built because: it's fun!

If you're looking for mature, feature rich browsers that support such technologies, please consider:

**DAT/Hypercore**

* [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) - A peer-to-peer browser for Web hackers (desktop)
* [Gateway Browser](https://twitter.com/GatewayBrowser) - An experimental mobile browser that aims to help build a sustainable community-owned P2P web (mobile)

**Ethereum**

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps
- [Status](https://status.im/) - Status is a secure messaging app, crypto wallet, and Web3 browser built with state of the art technology
