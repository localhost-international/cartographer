# Cartographer
_An experimental mobile web browser_

> Note: Cartographer is a very early work in progress, so approach with caution.

Cartographer is an experimental web browser, technology demo and user interface/experience playground.  
It's focus will be on supporting decentralised and peer to peer technologies such as DAT/Hypercore and web3, but is mainly being built because: it's a fun R&D project.

If you're looking for a mature/feature rich web browsers that support these technologies:

**DAT/Hypercore**

* [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) - A peer-to-peer browser for Web hackers (desktop)
* [Gateway Browser](https://twitter.com/GatewayBrowser) - An experimental mobile browser that aims to help build a sustainable community-owned P2P web (mobile)

**Ethereum**

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps
